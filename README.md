# About:
Traditional credit card companies are seeking to acquire new customers and optimize their
sales to surpass competitors and maintain an edge against competitors. There are two questions that we will address in this project: 
1. Can we segment credit card users based on their usage behavior? If so, what will be the profile of these
segments? 
2. How can we increase cash advance and installment purchase which are believed to be the main sources of credit companiesâ€™ revenues? 

## Data Source:
The Credit Card Dataset for Clustering was from Kaggle

## Pre-Requisites:
+ R and Cran packages
+ Github Account to publish project
+ Advance Clustering Knowledge
+ Programming knowledge to troubleshoot if somethings goes wrong or to fill in the blanks

## Data Visualizations:

## Conclusion: 
We were able to segment credit card users based on their behavior into four
clusters: active users, large purchase users, cash advance users, and non-active users. Every four
clusters had distinctive characteristics and behavioral patterns. Although for the second question, we could not see that users
who have more cash advances tend to purchase installment frequency or have a higher cash limit, but
we have seen many valuable findings that those traditional credit card companies can use for
their future strategies.
