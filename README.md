## About:
Traditional credit card companies are seeking to acquire new customers and optimize their
sales to surpass competitors and maintain an edge against competitors. There are two questions that we will address in this project: 
1. Can we segment credit card users based on their usage behavior? If so, what will be the profile of these
segments? 
2. How can we increase cash advance and installment purchase which are believed to
be the main sources of credit companiesâ€™ revenues?
